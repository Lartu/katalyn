The **Katalyn** programming language is a powerful scripting language designed to pair the simplicity of Lua with the power of Perl.
It integrates an intuitive syntax with a comprehensive, batteries-included standard library of useful functions _(under development)_. Whether you are
writing console scripts, calling APIs or parsing text, Katalyn helps you get things done without getting in the way!

```f#
(* Let's greet you! *)
in $name: accept("What's your name?");
print("Hello there, ", $name, "!");
```

## Installing Katalyn

## Learning Katalyn (the docs)

While the standard library includes many functions for different uses, the language is actually very minimal and easy to use.
